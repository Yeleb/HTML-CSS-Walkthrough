    <p>Monkey D. Luffy, the main protagonist of *One Piece*, is a free-spirited pirate known for his rubbery powers, unshakable determination, and dream of becoming the Pirate King. After eating the Gomu Gomu no Mi, Luffy gained the ability to stretch his body like rubber, which he creatively developed through various transformations called "Gears" to battle increasingly powerful foes throughout his journey across the seas.</p> 
    <p>His latest and most powerful transformation, Gear 5, was revealed during his fight with Kaido on Onigashima. Unlike previous Gears that relied on muscle enhancement or blood manipulation, Gear 5 unleashes a bizarre, cartoon-like freedom where Luffy can defy physical laws. This form amplifies his creativity and makes his rubber body nearly invincible, matching the energy and tone of classic, exaggerated cartoon antics.</p>

    <p>Gear 5 is tied to the true nature of Luffyâ€™s Devil Fruit, which is not the Gomu Gomu no Mi but the Hito Hito no Mi: Model Nika, a Mythical Zoan fruit. Nika, also known as the Sun God, was a legendary figure associated with liberation and joy. Luffy, unknowingly, inherited this power and spirit, and in awakening it during the climax of the Wano arc, he began embodying the joyful, liberating energy that Nika represents.</p> 
    <p>This transformation also revives the ancient legend of Joy Boy, a mysterious figure from the Void Century who once tried to bring freedom to the world. Luffy's awakening and Gear 5 transformation are widely believed to fulfill the long-awaited return of Joy Boy, connecting his will and laughter-filled fighting style to the spirit of Nika and the prophecy of a hero who would liberate the world from oppression.</p>
